# Medical_Diagnosis_using_AI

## Overview
The **Medical Diagnosis using AI** is an intelligent application designed to assist in diagnosing diseases based on symptoms provided by users. The system leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide accurate predictions and recommendations, aiding both medical professionals and patients in early diagnosis.

## Features
- **Symptom-Based Diagnosis**: Users input symptoms, and the system predicts potential diseases.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes trained models for improved accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for ease of use.
- **Integration with Medical Data**: Access to a vast database of medical conditions and symptoms.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides instant results based on input symptoms.
- **Secure & Private**: Ensures data privacy and confidentiality.

## Technologies Used
### Programming Languages:
- **Python** (Primary language for backend and AI model implementation)
- **HTML, CSS** (For minor UI enhancements)

### Frontend:
- **Streamlit** (For building the user interface)

### Backend:
- **Python** (Core processing, model training, and API handling)

### Machine Learning Models:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**

### Frameworks & Libraries:
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)** → Machine learning implementation
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data processing
